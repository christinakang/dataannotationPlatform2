Lila becomes concerned about the lack of information and clarity, as the event is supposed to take place in a month.\n\n As the event date approaches, Lila reaches out to Max once more, seeking confirmation and specific details. Max responds apologetically, stating that he had other arrangements and couldn't secure a venue for the event. He expresses his regret and explains that he won't be able to have Lila perform at the event anymore.\n\nLila is disappointed and frustrated, as she had prepared for the performance and even turned down other opportunities in anticipation of Max's event. She consults a legal expert to understand her options. The expert advises Lila that Max's initial expression of interest in having Lila perform may constitutes promise and the act of Lila accepting it turned the agreement into a contract . Notwithstanding such, the uncertainty in respect of the date and time of the event may renders the contract void ab intitio。",
