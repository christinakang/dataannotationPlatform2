Mike said, “Of course darling.” Lilian then decides to expand her business to include batik wear for men and children. On Monday she rings her dye supplier in Kuantan and talks to Neil. She discusses her plans to expand her tailoring business and her need to order additional fabric dye colours suitable for silk, synthetic and cotton fabrics.

She also inquires about gold and silver dyes, and is told by Neil that gold dyes are available for RM150 each, and silver for RM100. Lilian tells Neil that she is prepared to pay RM130 for the gold dye and RM80 for the silver. Lilian also tells Neil that if she doesn’t hear to the contrary, she will take 5 gold and 5 silver boxes of dye, to be delivered with the red dye on Friday. On Friday morning, Lilian receives a delivery from Neil of 24 boxes of red dye. Lilian rings Neil and told him there are no gold or silver dyes. Neil told Lilian he has decided not to supply them at Lilian’s price. Lilian later calls Mike and asks him to send over some fabric she needs at cost price as agreed. Mike replies that he will only provide her with fabric at market price. She protests and reminds him of last Friday evening. He replies, “That was dinner, this is business.” After Lilian hangs up, her assistant Olivia shows her an order for silk scarves on which she has been working using the red dye supplied by Neil.
