The advertisement placed by Vanessa to sell a limited edition vinyl for $500 is an Invitation to treat {Eckhardt Marine GMBH v Sheriff, High Court of Malaya, Seremban & Ors [2001] 4 MLJ 4 (CA)[3/4]}{LEGALLIZATION}. \n\n2. IF Vanessa’s advertisement is an invitation to treat, then {she receives a call from a customer, Niko, to reserve that vinyl.[Niko's reply to the invitation to treat]} is an offer {Section 2a}{Preston Corp Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong [1982] 2 MLJ 22 (FC)[2/4]}{LEGALLIZATION}. \n\n3. IF {Fine, I will reserve the vinyl for you until Wednesday 8pm. If I don’t hear from you by then, I will sell the vinyl for someone else[Vanessa's reply to the offer]} is an absolute and unqualified acceptance, then there is a valid acceptance {Section 7a}. \n\n4. IF {Fine, I will reserve the vinyl for you until Wednesday 8pm. If I don’t hear from you by then, I will sell the vinyl for someone else[Vanessa's reply to the offer]} is not an absolute and unqualified acceptance, then there is no acceptance {The Ka Wah Bank Ltd v Nadinusa Sdn Bhd [1998] 2 MLJ 350, FC[3/14]}. \n\n5. HOWEVER, even if (4), {When he came back to collect the vinyl on Wednesday at 4pm, he was annoyed to find out that the vinyl was sold.[The time when Niko wants to collect the vinyl]} is still within the prescribed time of Wednesday of 8pm. \n\n6. SINCE (5), then {Vanessa[Offeree]} is bound to reserve the vinyl for {Niko[Offeror]} as promised because the prescribed time has not lapsed yet {Section 6b}. \n\n7. The verbal promise made by {Vanessa[Offeree]} in reserving the vinyl for {Niko[Offeror]} until Wednesday 8pm can be deemed as an implied acceptance {Section 2d}{Section 10.2}{Affin Bank Bhd v Mohd Kasim Ibrahim [2012] MLJU 1794[125/17]}. \n\n8. SINCE (6) and (7), then there is a valid contract between {Vanessa[Offeree]} and {Niko[Offeror]}. \n\n9. UNLESS {Vanessa[Offeree]}did not hear back from {Niko[Offeror]} before Wednesday 8pm, then {Vanessa[Offeree]} is not bound to reserve the vinyl for {Niko[Offeror]}. \n\n10. According to {Section 6a}, a notice of revocation must be made by the offeror. \n\n11. SINCE (10), then {Vanessa then immediately calls Niko to inform him that the vinyl was sold to someone else but his phone was unreachable at the time[Notice of revocation]} is an invalid notice of revocation. \n\n12. SINCE (3), (6) and (11), then there is a valid contract between {Vanessa[Offeree]} and {Niko[Offeror]}. \n\n13. SINCE (12), the contract between {Ken[Third party offeror]} and {Vanessa[Offeree]} is invalid.
